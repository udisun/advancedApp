  "readme": "mean-shadow\n===========\n\nThis module goes hand in hand with the mean.io stack and allows any mean app to have endpoints to add/remove entities from any third party app.\n\nMEAN is a fullstack javascript platform for modern web applications.\nMEAN stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js.\nYou can find it and all the details regarding it in:\nhttp://www.mean.io/\n\nAfter installing this module you should require it by doing:\n```JavaScript\nvar options = {\n  disableAuth: false,\n  authMiddleware: auth.myNewAuthMiddleware\n};\nvar meanShadow = require('../node_modules/mean-shadow')(app, options);\n```\nThe options object should include \"authMiddleware\" which is a new middleware you should create inside of the app/routes/middlewares/authorization.js file.\nIf you need to disable the authorization which is a BAD IDEA, just pass \"disableAuth: true\".\n\nThen in order to add your own logic you can catch a shadow event by doing:\n```JavaScript\nmeanShadow.events.on('insert', function(data) {\n  // Do some cool and MEAN stuff\n});\n```\n\nThanks to the author Orit Persik for creating this.\n",
